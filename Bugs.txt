Known bugs and issues

Base Sizes
Many characters don't have this stat listed because I don't have miniatures of those characters and therefore I can't accurately state the size of their bases.

Rules
Some characters miss required references to general rules.

Anna Never
Her party lineup requirement (more light characters than dark ones) is not working properly.

Roster Printing
BattleScribe awkwardly prints rosters - need to fix it somehow.

Manipulation
This Wissenschaft organization advantage is not working properly.

Dawn of the Dead
This Black Sun organization advantage is not working properly.

ACC (Advantage Card Counter)
Due to the fact that BS does not want to adequately calculate the limit of cards based simply on the number of characters taken to the roster, an additional type of game points had to be introduced, which of course was not reflected in the original rules.
